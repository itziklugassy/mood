# Mood Indicator Web App

## Overview
This simple web application allows users to click buttons to express their current mood. Each button, when clicked, logs a specific mood-related message to the browser's console. This project serves as a basic demonstration of using JavaScript with HTML to handle user interactions.

## Features
- Display four mood buttons: Happy, Sad, Angry, and Surprised.
- On button click, the corresponding mood message is logged to the console.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- JavaScript

## Setup
To run this project, simply open the HTML file in any modern web browser. No additional installation is required.

## Usage
Click any of the mood buttons to see a console log indicating the selected mood:
- **Happy Button**: Logs "I'm happy".
- **Sad Button**: Logs "I'm sad".
- **Angry Button**: Logs "I'm Angry".
- **Surprised Button**: Logs "I'm Surprised".

## How It Works
The HTML file includes four buttons, each assigned to different emotional states. The JavaScript functions associated with these buttons are triggered on click events, logging a specific message for each mood.

## Future Enhancements
- Display the mood feedback directly on the webpage instead of the console.
- Add more interactive elements such as animations or sound effects corresponding to each mood.
- Improve the UI with CSS for a more engaging user experience.
